Homework #3: Building Your Company's Web-Based Information System - Customer Side
For this homework, you are going to build the customer-side of your website. This will allow your 'customer' to buy your products/services. Your web site must include the following new capabilities:
 A login page for customers that establishes a logon session variable in PHP to keep track of the user. This logon session variable MUST time out - for security reasons.
 Whatever scheme you want to come up with to allow users to order/view your products and services, it must include a shopping cart. You need to ask for enough information that you can 'send' the ordered items to the customer - so all customer address information is needed - and that the customer can pay for what they ordered (use a credit card, for instance).
 An ability to display the shopping cart during the ordering process.
 The ability to edit (change quantity, or remove an item), or even delete, the
entire shopping cart and start over.
 A page so customers can create their own login and profile. They also must be
able to edit their profile, including their password.
 Pages for customers to view what they have ordered from you in the past. This
is to include a summary page that displays one (or two) line(s) for each prior order and when a button, or something on that line is clicked, the detail for that order is displayed (similar to what you did in assignment 1).
 Managers get new reports to see all about orders. They are to be able to retrieve orders, and summaries of product sold by date, by product category, by special sales items, by product, sorted by total quantity sold, or sorted by total sales of products . Note: A single request could provide values for all three organizing ways. For example, a manager wants the total sales for a specific product category, for a specific time frame they specify.
 The display of special sales on the initial login page for customers, and a smaller display of appropriate special sales items on each product category, or product page. By appropriate, I mean related products - like those of the same product category.
