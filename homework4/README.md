Assignment #4: Redo Assignment 3 with CodeIgniter, AngularJS, and Responsive Web Design
You are to redo your third homework using as much CodeIgniter as possible on the server side. On the client side, you are to use AngularJS for all your dynamic HTML.
For the server side, are to create controllers, views, and models for this assignment. Your SQL code goes into your models. All output for the user interface goes into your views. The job of your controllers is to validate any session variables, retrieve and validate any $_POST/$_GET data, load the model (or models), passing the appropriate data through an associative array, then call one, or more, views to generate the output. This pattern is to be followed even for AJAX requests.
Only the Customer side of assignment 3 is to be done for assignment 4.
You are also to ensure that your assignment 4 is safe from cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
Lastly, you are to use Responsive Web Design for your user interface. You can either use CSS media queries or AngularJS.
